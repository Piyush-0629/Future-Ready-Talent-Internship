# Future-Ready-Talent-Internship

Problem Statement :
An e-commerce organisation wishes to create a sample Front End prototype website for their enterprise because eCommerce problems and the online buying sector are both expanding rapidly. They have decided to utilise Azure Cloud Platform to develop an entire website. Created a website with the following pages: the Home Page, Product Detail Page, Cart, Product Category Page, and Checkout Page. The Website should also have a FAQ Bot installed for customer support.

Project Description:
The main goal of the project is to use HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT to construct an example prototype E-Commerce Website with a FAQ Bot for a commercial organisation. The most obvious commercial use of the World Wide Web is the business-to-consumer element of product commerce (e-commerce). A sample prototype of an e-commerce site's main objective is to sell products online while quickly resolving client issues with a FAQ Bot. The creation of an e-commerce website for online product sales is the focus of this project. It offers the user a list of the many goods that may be bought in the shop. The user is given access to a shopping cart to make online purchases easier. In order to finish this project, we're combining GitHub and Azure Technologies.

Primary Azure Technology:
Azure Bot Service, QnA Maker, Static Web Apps,

Other Azure Technologies:
App Service, VS code
